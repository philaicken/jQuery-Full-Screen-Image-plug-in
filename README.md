jQuery Full Screen Image plug-in
================================

Introduction
------------

Large imagery has become a huge trend in web design of recent years, be it via the original use within flash based websites to recent time where people are truly utilising the power of JavaScript. With its prominence so large within web design, one would expect there to be several plug-ins already on the market to deal with full screen imagery. However, this is simply not the case, most plug-ins we came across either did not have the browser support that we desired or it fell short of the functionality we required. Therefore we decided to build a plug-in that could fill the void in the market.
